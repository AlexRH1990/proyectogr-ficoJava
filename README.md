# Java Project: Task Management System

## Overview
This project is a Java-based Task Management System that enables the management and assignment of tasks to different users. It includes functionalities for creating tasks, assigning them to specific users, and managing the completion of tasks. The project is built using Java and follows object-oriented programming principles.

## Key Files
- **`Encargado.class`**: This compiled Java class likely represents the "Encargado" (Manager) entity in the system, responsible for managing tasks and assigning them to users.

- **`Proyecto1.class`**: This compiled Java class likely represents the main entry point of the project or a significant component of the system that ties together different functionalities.

- **`Tarea.class`**: This compiled Java class likely represents the "Tarea" (Task) entity in the system, encapsulating details such as the task description, assigned user, and status.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A Java IDE or text editor
- Command-line interface or terminal for compiling and running the Java classes

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**: If you have the source `.java` files, compile them using the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

3. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled classes using the following command:
    ```bash
    java Proyecto1
    ```
    Ensure that the `Proyecto1.class` contains the `main` method to serve as the entry point of the application.

## Usage
- **Task Management**: Use the system to create, assign, and track tasks. The specific functionality and how to interact with the system depend on the methods defined within the classes.
- **User Management**: Assign tasks to different users using the `Encargado` class, and manage task statuses using the `Tarea` class.

## Key Technologies
- **Java**: The primary programming language used to build the Task Management System.
